# Fruit Tree Analyser

Solo Project: Semester 4


## Description
This project allows the user to import an image depicting fruit bearing bushes or trees from their machine and display it onto the GUI. From there they can click on a piece of fruit and carry out various image manipulation and calculations based on pixels.

Implemented the union-find algorithm, sorting, a hash map for storing individual clusters of fruit and searching based on size, image noise reduction to remove outliers using inter quartile range, an assortment of JUnit tests to ensure code functionality despite frequent refactoring during the project and JMH Benchmarking of main methods.
